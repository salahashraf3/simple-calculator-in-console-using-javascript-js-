# simple-calculator-in-console-using-javascript-js-
This is a simple code for creating a simple calculator in console using js . This  project started when i was learning javascript ,so after taking the basic js lessons i wanted to build a  calculator using prompt and alert function soo after failing for a while I tried finding solutions on the internet but i could not find the answer that i was looking for . It happend maybe because of my poor english as you could see but anyhow i started to biuld my own simple calculator using js in the console. So that's basically it I guess......
